# pichiller


# Why?
There is a commercial product offered for sale for an obsenely high $400 price point that is designed to allow a user to leverage the cooling power of a window AC unit to create a walk in cooler.  It is the goal of this pichiller repo to do the same thing for way cheaper using a raspberry pi and some cheap off the shelf sensors. 

# Getting Started

## Setup
Perform an apt-get update and upgrade, enable ssh, and enable one-wire in the raspi-config.  

I'm running a Rpi3 with the links here, but I did check earlier and there are both Grafana and Prometheus releases for ArmV6 so you should be able to do this with a Rpi2 or Rpi Zero.
